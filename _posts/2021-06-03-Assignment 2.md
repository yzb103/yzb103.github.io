Everyone in this course had some programming experience coming in (due to the prerequisites).  What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used?  
A: I have used SAS, SPSS, Stata, Mplus, and R. All those software are statistics tools. I use SAS for data management, use Stata to do general data analysis, and use MPlus to conduct multilevel analysis and SEM analysis. I know R for a long time but rarely used it until I was enrolled the program last year.

What functionality do you like about R?  
A:  I am not a fan of R because most the work R can do can be done by SAS and Stata. The only one feature attracting me is R Markdown. I can use Markdown to create a nice report with statistics tables and graphs. Neither SAS nor Stata has such function. 

What parts do you miss about your other language?  
A: I am not sure whether R could handle a huge-size data set. But SAS can do that. The data I manage and analyze is often greater than 10 G. In addition, Stata can plot a nice and colorful plot but I have not seen R can do it by now.

Do you consider R a difficult language to learn? (If you knew R prior to the course, describe your experience when first learning it.)
A: R is a difficult language to learn, compared to SAS and Stata. I think R does not have a comprehensive Userâ€™s Guide as readable as Stata. I often find myself confused because of few examples and lack of explanation on options.
