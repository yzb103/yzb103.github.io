Project 2 is about creating predictive models and automating Markdown reports. It is a group project. You can find our project [here](https://github.com/yzb103/ST558_Project-2). 

Letâ€™s me summarize what we did. First, we read the data and selected part of it based on weekday. Second, we form a training and test data set. Third, we created summary statistics and plots about the training data. Fourth, we applied 4 models to the training data: 2 linear models, a random forest model, and a boosted tree model. Fifth, we compared 4 models on the test data set. The best model was selected based on RSME. Sixth, we used a parameter to automatically generate an analysis report for each weekday variable.
